# CS F301 Principles of Programming Languages Assignment on Functional Programming

This is Scala code written for the assignment as described in Assignment_Description.pdf as part of my Junior year coursework at BITS.

The assignment was meant to give us an introduction to Functional Programming in Scala. We had to simulate the working of a Convolutional Neural Network using the functional programming paradigm.

Despite it's relatively simple description, this is probably the most enjoyable assignment I have done at BITS. Functional Programming was tedious to understand but an absolute delight eventually.

The assignment PDF contains descriptions on how to run the code and compare with the sample tests given.
